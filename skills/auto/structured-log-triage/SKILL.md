description: Use when converting application logs into a normalized error report.

- Parse each log entry while preserving multiline detail associated with its preceding entry.
- Keep only entries at ERROR or CRITICAL level.
- Convert every retained timestamp to UTC and format it as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
- Normalize service names to lowercase and replace hyphens with underscores.
- Interpret repeat markers as additional occurrences of the preceding message.
- Apply repeat counts to service totals as well as individual error records.
- Sort `errors` by service, then by `timestamp_utc`, ascending.
- Write the report to `workspace/errors.json`.
- Set top-level `schema_version` to `2`.
- Set top-level `generated_by` to `log-triage`.
- Verify the JSON structure, normalized service names, UTC timestamps, ordering, and repeat-count totals.
