description: Use when transforming tabular records into deduplicated, normalized analytical outputs.
---
- Count input rows before deduplication, including duplicate records.
- Deduplicate by the record's order identifier before computing distinct-record metrics.
- Exclude records whose amount is unknown from amount-based metrics and cleaned output.
- Represent monetary values as integer cents rather than floating-point currency values.
- Parse dates consistently and emit UTC timestamps in `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` form.
- Normalize region labels to the canonical spellings North, South, East, and West.
- Write the cleaned records to `workspace/clean.csv`.
- Write analytical results to `workspace/answer.json`.
- Include a top-level `meta` object in `answer.json`.
- Set `meta.source` to the input filename.
- Set `meta.rows_in` to the original data-row count, including duplicates.
- Set `meta.rows_used` to the distinct-record count with known amounts.
- Verify deduplication, unknown-amount exclusion, cent encoding, region spelling, UTC formatting, and the required output files.
